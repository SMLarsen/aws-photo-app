#AWS PHOTO APP

##Purpose

Application to store photos in folders on cloud using Amazon Web Services (S3).  This trial application has been designed for straight-forward porting to the Travelogger app.  

Starting with the AWS S3 sample app, this app has been refactored to move the S3 calls to the server.  In addition, a PostgreSQL database has been added to store additional information.
